_Homework_

* Problem Set 1: Due Thursday, 2/13/2014 (by the beginning of class)
* Create a short reproducible document (using knitr) that describes the basic structure of a dataset and summarizes some key features of the data using a few key tables and figures. Choose a dataset from [these datasets](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/DataSets) or the ones in the class Google Drive. If your dataset has a lot of variables, focus on a subset of them -- less than 6 or so -- for the purposes of this exercise. Your write-up should answer the following questions:
  * What is the background/context for this data? 
  * How many observations are there?
  * What is the unit of observation?
  * Is there any missing data? If so, are there patterns to the missingness?
  * What are the key variables and what do their distributions look like?
  * Is there a pair of variables that might work well for a Simple Linear Regression? (You don't necessarily need to run one, but you could.)
  * Are there any obvious outliers in the data?

#### Class 3 (Jan 28): Geometry of regression and least squares
_Activities_

* warm-ups (10 min)
* mini-lecture: least squares and geometry of regression (30 min)

* Add one or two simple linear regressions to your dataset write-up. 
* Finish OpenIntro Lab 7.

_Homework_

* Problem Set 1: Due Thursday, 2/13/2014 (by the beginning of class)
* In your small groups, create a write-up for a simple analysis of the BtheB dataset. Each group should create a repository on GitHub for their analysis. The .Rnw or .Rmd file that you use should be in that repository and every member of the group should have at least one commit or push to the repository before the next class. (You should not commit any additional files, like the .aux files from LaTeX compiling, just the files that are needed to comile your analysis.) Here is a minimal list of things that should be included in your write-up. I encourage you to push beyond just this list, however. 
  * A few sentences of background/context for the BtheB dataset.
  * A quantitative and/or visual description of what variables you chose to use for your analysis, along with a hypothesis (or two) that you will be testing.
  * A description of the characteristics of the missing data (including a figure if needed) and a statement and justification as to whether your group is concerned about the missingness having an impact on your analysis.
  * Results, with interpretation, of output from an SLR model. We haven't discussed yet using binary predictors or X variables, but feel free to include them. The interpretation is very similar. "For a one unit change in X, ..."
* Read [this description](http://nicercode.github.io/guides/functions/) of how to write and use functions in R.

#### Class 5 (Feb 4): R^2, ANOVA
_Activities_

* warm-ups (10 min)
* lecture: SLR final concepts (40 min)
* writing functions in R (15 min)

_Homework_

* Problem Set 1: Due Thursday, 2/13/2014 (by the beginning of class)
* Create a "slr()" R function that takes x and y vectors and outputs a list with two objects: (1) a fitted lm() object and (2) by-hand betas (calculated by likelihood or formulae). Try to write this as a function, but if you have trouble, then just write it as a few lines of R code and create an object as described.
* Use this new slr() function/code to refit the SLR models in your dataset writeup. Compare the results and make sure they are returning the same thing. 

#### Class 6 (Feb 6): Version control

* Visualization assignment: Please dig through the scientific literature (no limit on the discipline, but I'd encourage you to look in the literature for your field) and find a paper that uses some form of multiple linear regression models. The paper should be about modeling a continuous outcome (no logistic/log-linear/etc.. models) and could incorporate some more fancy modeling things than we've talked about (e.g. spline terms, polynomials, random effects). The paper should have a figure/graphic in it that attempts to visualize features of the regression. Post a link to the paper on Piazza (either a URL or a PDF file), with a note about which graphic you think is most relevant to the discussion, and describe what tool(s) you used to find the paper (e.g. Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, ...). Feel free to comment/start discussion on papers that other students post, but everyone is expected to find their own paper. I'll choose one that we'll talk about in more detail on Tuesday.
