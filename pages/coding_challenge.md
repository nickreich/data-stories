These are short assignments designed to help you get more comfortable with using R, while also challenging you in the language. They are meant to increase your ability to find solutions on your own and also increase communication between you and your peers, TAs, and instructor.

Coding Challenges will be posted on the **schedule** page (abbreviated *CC*) one week before the due date. Challenges will generally be due on Fridays at 7pm submitted as an html file to the studentâ€™s google drive folder. Submissions will be assessed over the following week.

There will be a total of 5 challenges, each worth a total of 20 points. Answer keys will be posted after the due date with the breakdown of points. The challenges will contribute to your homework grade, however, the denominator for the coding challenge portion will be 60 points. The grade from your lowest submission will be completely dropped. Your highest four grades will be used to determine the numerator for your coding challenge grade. This means that you could completely ignore two challenges and not be penalized on your grade. Or you could do all of them, and receive extra credit. 

_For Example:_  
Homework Grade: 100/140 (71%)
Coding Challenge Grades: 10, 20, 20, 5, 10. After lowest grade dropped, total of 60 points earned. Denominator is 60 points.

Total Homework Grade: 160/200 (80%)
