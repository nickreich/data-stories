_Tuesday, week 1_

 - Welcome & overview of course  (15 min)
    - review course website and course goals
    - open vs. closed computers/phones/devices
    - introduce book, refer to website
    - introduce TAs (that are here)
    - expectations of team-based learning: not all TBL, still some standard lectures, some team projects
    - expectations of individual students: I have high expectations for what students will achieve in the course. requires both individual effort and collaboration.
    - R: I will use it and teach with it. If you need help learning it, take Sara's class (PUBHLTH 497D), or do online modules. We will assume working knowledge that is developing over the semester.
    - trajectory of course: starts out squishy, gets tough fast

 - Wits and wagers (15 min):
    `qplot(x, geom="dotplot") + geom_vline(xintercept=9, color="red")`

 - Lecture: Intro to telling stories with data (45 min)
 
 - HW: Install R, RStudio, register for Slack, read syllabus
 - complete pre-semester student survey

_Thursday, week 1_

 - course technology intro: website, piazza, Google Drive (20 min)
 - TA office hours (coming soon)

   - Work as a group on Lab1 (start piazza teams!)
   - create and share a google drive folder (see slack for directions)
 
_Tuesday, week 2_

 - Lecture 2: "On statistics, sampling, and data structures", including showing some R work (50 min)
 - continuation of R code from lecture: run a few more versions of the simulation studies with different sample sizes. maybe compute different summary statistics. what summary statistics do you want to see?
 - continue group work on project (remainder of time)
 
_Thursday, week 2_

 - presentations on data collection exercises (50 min)
 - wrap-up discussion on what they learned from data collection process and how to do it in such a way as to make data analysis go smoothly
 - talk more about sampling biases. Currently, they are assigned to read the ["gay face" study](https://osf.io/fk3xr/) and a [critique by Dan Simpson](http://andrewgelman.com/2017/09/12/seemed-destruction-done-not-choose-two/) from Andrew Gelman's blog. 
 - possible prompt for group discussions: How does Simpson's critique of the gay face study relate to sampling issues that we have discussed in class and that you may have faced in your project?
 - group discussions about what went well/poorly in terms of group communication/working together.
 - reminder of HW of reading about data visualization

_Thurs, week 4_

 - announcements: 
 - Piazza announcement: 
We will be spending the rest of this week and all of next week on linear regression. I have posted Lab 3 on the schedules page of the website. It is due next Friday, Oct 5. To complete this lab, and to keep up with the discussions in class, you will need to read the textbook (chapters 6-7 this week, chapters 8-9 next week) and watch the content in the OpenIntro YouTube playlist called "Intro to Linear Regression". The playlist is 4 videos and all together is less than 20 minutes. 

Note that the content on the videos and in the book is not content that we are covering in class, so I am expecting that you will watch these and do the reading on your own. They will provide useful perspective, additional depth, and technical details to supplement what we cover in class. 

The content in both the book and the videos will be needed to complete Lab 3 and all of that content will be fair game to be included on the midterm exam.

Let me or the other instructors know if you have any questions!

 _Thurs, week 12_

 - draft of group analysis should have been handed in via Google Drive on Wednesday.
 - activity for Thursday: at each table, the groups share with the other team at their table their write-up. Each group takes a turn critiquing the other write-up. I'm thinking a structure like
     - 5-10 minutes for everyone to read the other group's work
     - each person write down, about the write-up from the other group, 2 things they like, 2-4 specific things they think could be improved
     - go around the table and share the constructive feedback

   - individual analyses due Wednesday
 - go over sample project, critique in small groups, move to large groups
