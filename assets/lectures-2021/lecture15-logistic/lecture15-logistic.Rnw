\item Simple linear regression
\begin{itemize}
\item Relationship between numerical response and a numerical or categorical predictor
\end{itemize}
\item Multiple regression
\begin{itemize}
\item Relationship between numerical response and multiple numerical and/or categorical predictors

In linear regression, when y is a continuous variable, our model estimates for us the average $y$, $\hat y$, value for a particular value of $x$.

When y is a binary outcome variable, regression models can still estimate for us the average $y$, $\hat y$, but now it represents something different: the probability that $y = 1$, or $P(Y=1)$.

\frametitle{Example - Birdkeeping and Lung Cancer}

A 1972 - 1981 health survey in The Hague, Netherlands, discovered an association between keeping pet birds and increased risk of lung cancer. To investigate birdkeeping as a risk factor, researchers conducted a case-control study of patients in 1985 at four hospitals in The Hague (population 450,000). They identified 49 cases of lung cancer among the patients who were registered with a general practice, who were age 65 or younger and who had resided in the city since 1965. They also selected 98 controls from a population of residents having the same general age structure.

\frametitle{Brief detour: what are the ``odds''?}

\vspace{-2mm}

Odds are another way of quantifying the probability of an event, commonly used in gambling (and logistic regression).\\

~\\

{
For some event $E$,
{\small
\[\text{odds}(E) = \frac{P(E)}{P(E^c)} = \frac{P(E)}{1-P(E)}\]
}
and
{\small
\[\text{P}(E) = \frac{odds(E)}{1+odds(E)}\]
}
Similarly, if we are told the odds of E are $x$ to $y$ then
{\small
\[\text{odds}(E) = \frac{x}{y} = \frac{x/(x+y)}{y/(x+y)} \]
}
which implies
{\small
\[P(E) = x/(x+y),\quad P(E^c) = y/(x+y)\]
}
}

\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Odds Ratios}

\vspace{-2mm}

Odds Ratios compare the odds of an event in two different groups.\\

%~\\


For some outcome of interest (say, disease) in two groups, (e.g. exposed and unexposed),

%$odds_A(Y) = \frac{P_A(Y)}{1-P_A(Y)}$

%$OR_{A v B} = \frac{odds_A}{odds_B}$

\[OR = \frac{P(\text{disease} | \text{exposed}) / [1-P(\text{disease} | \text{exposed})]}{P(\text{disease} | \text{unexposed})/[1-P(\text{disease} | \text{unexposed})]} \]

\begin{block}{Facts about Odds Ratios}
\begin{itemize}
  \myitem ORs have range of (0, $\infty$). 
  \myitem OR = 1 means no difference between the groups.
  \myitem They have a multiplicative scale: e.g. OR = 0.5 and OR = 2 both indicate that one group has twice the odds of another.
  \myitem This means that the log OR is on an additive scale of odds (This is important for logistic regression!).
  \myitem OR is not a ratio of probabilities.
\end{itemize}

A logistic regression model can be defined as follows:

$$Y_i | \mathbf x_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p_i)$$
$$Pr(Y_i=1|\mathbf x_i) = p_i$$
$$logit (p_i) = \log \frac{p_i}{1-p_i}  = \eta =  \beta_0+\beta_1 X_{i1} + \cdots + \beta_p X_{ip}$$

Keeping all other predictors constant then,
\begin{itemize}

\item The odds ratio of getting lung cancer for bird keepers vs non-bird keepers is $\exp(1.3626) = 3.91$.

\item The odds ratio of getting lung cancer for an additional year of smoking is $\exp(0.0729) = 1.08$. I.e. for every year an individual smokes, the odds of lung cancer increase by 8\%. 

\item The odds ratio of getting lung cancer for an additional 10 years of smoking is $\exp(0.0729*10) = 2.07$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What the numbers do not mean ...}

The most common mistake made when interpreting logistic regression is to treat an odds ratio as a ratio of probabilities.\\

~\\ 

Bird keepers are \emph{not} 4x more likely to develop lung cancer than non-bird keepers.

~\\ 

This is the difference between relative risk and an odds ratio.


\[RR = \frac{P(\text{disease} | \text{exposed})}{P(\text{disease} | \text{unexposed})} \]

\[OR = \frac{P(\text{disease} | \text{exposed}) / [1-P(\text{disease} | \text{exposed})]}{P(\text{disease} | \text{unexposed})/[1-P(\text{disease} | \text{unexposed})]} \]


\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Measuring accuracy of a model for binary outcomes}

A common metric for evaluating models for binary outcomes is simply called the ``accuracy''. 

It requires specifying a threshold ($c$) for the predicted probability ($\hat p_i$) that an individual has the outcome of interest. For a given threshold, we say that 
\[
    \hat y_i(c)= 
\begin{cases}
    1,    & \text{if }p_i \geq c\\
    0,  & \text{if } p_i < c\\ 
\end{cases}
\]

And then the accuracy, for a given $c$ is defined
$$ accuracy(c) = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1- | \hat y_i(c) - y_i | }{N} $$.

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Measuring accuracy across all thresholds}

To gain a full picture of the accuracy of your model, you want to compute the accuracy for all possible values of $c$. This is what the ROC curve does:


<<fig.show='asis', fig.height=3.5>>=
library(ROCR)
birds$phat <- predict(fm1, type="response")
pred <- prediction(birds$phat, birds$LCnum)
perf <- performance(pred,"tpr","fpr")
plot(perf)
@



\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Measuring accuracy across all thresholds}

The "area under the curve" (AUC) is a common single measure of predictive accuracy of a model. It can be interpreted as {\em the probability, if one random individual with the outcome and one without were drawn from your dataset, that your model would accurately assign a higher $p_i$ to the one with the outcome.}

<<>>=
## this prints out the computed area under the curve
performance(pred,"auc")@y.values

<<fig.height=3.5, echo=FALSE>>=
