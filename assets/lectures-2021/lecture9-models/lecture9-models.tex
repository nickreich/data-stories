\begin{frame}{Statistical modeling}

The process of using data to describe the relationship between outcomes and predictors is called modeling.
\bi
  \myitem Models are models, not reality.
  \myitem ``All models are wrong, but some are useful." 
  \myitem Introduce structure to our model that balances realism with ``goodness of fit''. 
\ei

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Models are functions}

Definition: ``a {\bf function} is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of permissible outputs with the property that each input is related to exactly one output''.\footnote{Wikipedia, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)}{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function\_(mathematics)}}

\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{figure-static/Function_machine2}  

In statistical models, inputs are explanatory variables and outputs are ``typical'' or ``expected'' values of response variables. %There is always residual variation. The key challenge is judging whether the structure of a particular model is supported by evidence in the data.



\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Models are functions: response variable}

Definition: ``a {\bf function} is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of permissible outputs with the property that each input is related to exactly one output''.\footnote{Wikipedia, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)}{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function\_(mathematics)}}

\vspace{2em}



We might write generally $$ y = f(x)$$ where $x$ could be a single variable or multiple variables.

\vspace{1em}

\bi
  \myitem {\bf The response variable} is $y$ the variable whose behavior or variation you are trying to understand. We might also call this the {\bf outcome variable}.
\ei

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{A common modeling tool: regression}

\bi
        \myitem The goal is to learn about the relationship between ``explanatory'' (or ``predictor'') variables of interest and a ``response`` (or  ``outcome'') of interest.
	\bi
		\myitem Some models focus on prediction.
		\myitem Other models focus on description.
	\ei
	\myitem Regression is an exercise in inferential statistics: we are drawing evidence and conclusions from data about ``complex aspects of reality'', i.e. ``noisy'' systems.
\ei

\begin{frame}[t]{Lung data example}

99 observations on patients who have sought treatment for the relief of respiratory disease symptoms. 

The variables are:
\bi
    \myitem {\tt disease} measure of disease severity (larger values indicates more serious condition).
    \myitem {\tt education} highest grade completed
    \myitem {\tt crowding} measure of crowding of living quarters (larger values indicate more crowding)
    \myitem {\tt airqual} measure of air quality at place of residence (larger number indicates poorer quality)
    \myitem {\tt nutrition} nutritional status (larger number indicates better nutrition)
    \myitem {\tt smoking} smoking status (1 if smoker, 0 if non-smoker)
\ei

What is the natural response variable here? Which variable are we trying to understand or explain?

We might write generally $$ y = f(x) $$ where $x$ could be a single variable or multiple variables.

\begin{block}{What will the "structure" of the model look like?}

  \myitem Most models we talk about will be a form of {\bf linear models}, e.g. $$ y = f(x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x $$.
  \myitem You must make a choice about {\bf model terms}. What does the right hand side of the above equation look like?

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Model terms: the intercept}

The intercept is a ``baseline`` that is included in nearly every model. What would your guess of disease severity be in the absence of any other information? $$y = \beta_0 $$
